<h2>Career Goals</h2>
<p>My career goal is to become a 3D animator/modeler.  I am hoping to transfer to CSU East Bay and take their 4 year animation program.  I have always grown up loving anything related to video games and animated movies, so this career is a dream come true!  As my dream job I would like to be either an animator at a video game company or animation studio.  I would also like to 3D model as possibly a side job.</p>

<h2>Web Design Knowledge</h2>
<p>I have taken a web design course back in high school so I know about the foundations of building a website.  I also somewhat remember the key terms for web design like the basics of meta names and hrefs.  I created my old high school website using HTM so I am hoping that this class will be able to explore more of the HTML and CSS side.</p>

<h2>Goals for Learning</h2>
<p>I hope to relearn everything about web design, but learn it, enjoying the process.  During my high school class I never really fully enjoyed the web design process so hopefully this class will change my mind!  I am wanting to learn more about CSS since in my high school class we never really got to that point.  I would also like to learn HTML again with the key terms and just knowledge of the coding language.</p>
