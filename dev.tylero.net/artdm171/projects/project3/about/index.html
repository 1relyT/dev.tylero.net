<h2>The Inn – Relax and Refresh at our B&B in Provincetown Village.</h2>
<section class="main_about">


<p>All seven air-conditioned rooms have queen or king-size beds with luxurious linens, cozy sitting areas, and private baths en suite complete with fresh flowers, chocolates, robes, and a basket of amenities. Each has a fireplace or stove, and several have whirlpool baths. The common areas invite you to relax by the fire, savor a glass of sherry or port, and visit with your friends or fellow guests. The main house and the carriage house each have a variety of room styles to fit your needs, whether you’re looking for a romantic and cozy room for two or family accommodations for up to four.</p>

<p>Provincetown Village is a perfect location for strolling and exploring the shops, museums, and restaurants that are unique to our town.  The Provincetown boardwalk is a short walk from the inn where you can enjoy the beauty of the salt marsh and views across Cape Cod Bay.</p>
